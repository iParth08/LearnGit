# LearnGit
This contains my (Version Control System) git learning.

## Introduction

_Git is a version control system that helps in maintaining code and multiple versions of any software._ <br>
Git provides two prominent features:
- History of Code :: Git saves snapshots of codes to which we can revert any time.
- Collaboration   :: Allows multiple collaborators to work independently then merge.

## Basic Set-up

**_Configuration of Contributor(Editor)_**
```sh
 git config --global user.name _"User Name"_
 git config --global user.email _"user123@email.com"_
 git config --list
```
